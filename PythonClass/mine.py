#a is 200, and b is 100.
#We conclude by the order, where first variable is a and a value is 200.

#In Positional arguments order is very important.
#If we interchange the order the result will be changes
#sub(100)-->This is invalid because of missing positional arguments.
#For positional arguments, order of arguments is very important and also no of arguments is also imp.
